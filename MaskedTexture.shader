//Shader: TextureMask
//This simple shader will mask off areas of a texture. This is useful for, say, when you really want to make your minimap round. I’ve designed it with GUI elements in mind. To make a round object you would:

//* put a black border around a white circle and import that into unity.
//* Change the texture format to Alpha 8 bit and check ‘Build Alpha from Grayscale’
//* Create a shader with the code below.
//* Create a new plane and import your texture on to it.
//* Select the shader you created.
//* Drop your culling mask in to it.

      _MainTex ("Base (RGB)", 2D) = "white" {}
      _Mask ("Culling Mask", 2D) = "white" {}
      _Cutoff ("Alpha cutoff", Range (0,1)) = 0.1
   }

         SetTexture [_MainTex] {combine texture, previous}
      }
   }
